# Multi-Thread Scheduling - Complete! 🎉

**Feature**: Proactive Assistant with Multiple Thread Detection  
**Status**: ✅ Complete - Ready to deploy

---

## 🎯 **What Was Built**

### **Backend** (`schedulingAgent.js`):
1. ✅ Detects **ALL scheduling requests** (not just best one)
2. ✅ Each thread gets its own time suggestions
3. ✅ Scans for availability hints near each thread
4. ✅ Returns array of threads with full details

### **Frontend** (`ProactiveAssistantScreen.tsx`):
1. ✅ **Thread List View** - Shows all detected scheduling requests
2. ✅ **Thread Detail View** - Drill-down to time suggestions
3. ✅ **Back navigation** - Thread detail → Thread list
4. ✅ **Share & Confirm** - For each thread independently

## 🧠 **Intelligence Features**

### **1. Multiple Thread Detection**:
- Scans entire conversation
- Finds ALL scheduling hints (not just one)
- Marks nearby messages as processed (no duplicates)
- Each thread tracked independently

### **2. Availability Awareness**:
- Looks for "I'm available...", "3pm works for me"
- Associates with nearby scheduling requests
- Uses mentioned times in suggestions

### **3. Smart Suggestions Per Thread**:
- Thread with "tomorrow at 2pm" → Suggests times around 2pm on tomorrow
- Thread with "next week" → Suggests default times next week
- Thread with availability hints → Uses those specific times
