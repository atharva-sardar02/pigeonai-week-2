# Background Notifications - Implementation Guide

**Status**: ✅ Automatically Handled by Expo  
**Last Updated**: October 21, 2025

---

## Overview

Background notifications in our app are **automatically handled** by Expo Push Notification service and the native operating systems (iOS and Android). No additional code is required beyond what we've already implemented in Tasks 10.1-10.9.

---

## How Background Notifications Work

### What is a "Background Notification"?

A **background notification** is a push notification that arrives when:
- The app is **not in the foreground** (user is on home screen or using another app)
- The app is **completely closed** (not running at all)

### Automatic Handling

When a notification arrives while the app is in the background:

```
Expo Push Service → FCM/APNs → Device OS → System Notification
```

The **operating system** (iOS or Android) handles:
- ✅ Displaying the notification banner
- ✅ Playing notification sound
- ✅ Vibrating the device
- ✅ Adding to notification center
- ✅ Showing app badge count
- ✅ Waking up the app when notification is tapped

---

## Configuration Already in Place

### 1. App Configuration (`app.config.js`)

```javascript
plugins: [
  [
    'expo-notifications',
    {
      icon: './assets/icon.png',
      color: '#3B82F6',
      sounds: [],
    }
  ]
],
android: {
  permissions: [
    'RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED',  // Receive notifications after device reboot
    'VIBRATE',                  // Vibrate on notification
    'android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS' // Android 13+ permission
  ],
}
```

### 2. Notification Handler (`notificationService.ts`)

```javascript
Notifications.setNotificationHandler({
  handleNotification: async () => ({
    shouldShowAlert: true,   // Show alert when app is in foreground
    shouldPlaySound: true,   // Play sound
    shouldSetBadge: true,    // Update badge count
  }),
});
```

This configuration tells Expo how to handle notifications when the app is **in the foreground**. When in the background, the OS handles it automatically.

### 3. Android Notification Channel

```javascript
await Notifications.setNotificationChannelAsync('default', {
  name: 'Default',
  importance: Notifications.AndroidImportance.MAX,
  vibrationPattern: [0, 250, 250, 250],
  lightColor: '#3B82F6',
  sound: 'default',
});
```

This ensures notifications on Android are displayed with high priority, vibration, and sound.

## Notification Behavior by State

### 1. App in Foreground (Open and Visible)
**What happens:**
- Custom notification banner slides down from top
- User sees sender name and message preview
- Notification sound plays (optional)
- Banner auto-dismisses after 4 seconds

**Code location:** `App.tsx` - Custom banner component

---

### 2. App in Background (Not Visible)
**What happens:**
- **iOS**: Notification banner appears at top of screen
- **Android**: Notification appears in status bar
- Notification sound plays
- Device vibrates (if enabled)
- Notification added to notification center

**Handled by:** iOS/Android OS (automatic)

---

### 3. App Completely Closed
**What happens:**
- Same as background behavior
- App **does NOT start** until user taps notification
- When tapped, app launches and navigates to chat

**Handled by:** iOS/Android OS (automatic)

---

## iOS-Specific Behavior

### Notification Banners
- Appears at top of screen
- Shows app icon, title, and message
- Swipe down to expand and see actions
- Swipe up to dismiss

### Notification Center
- Swipe down from top to see all notifications
- Grouped by app
- Can clear individual or all notifications

### Lock Screen
- Notifications appear on lock screen (if permission granted)
- Face ID/Touch ID to open app from notification

### Do Not Disturb
- Notifications are silenced if DND is enabled
- Still appear in notification center

---

## Android-Specific Behavior

### Notification Drawer
- Swipe down from top to see notifications
- Grouped by app and conversation (if configured)
- Expandable to show full message

### Notification Channels
- Users can customize per-channel settings
- Our app uses "Default" channel
- Users can change sound, vibration, importance

### Battery Optimization
- Some Android devices aggressively kill apps
- May affect notification delivery
- Solution: Ask users to disable battery optimization for our app

2. **Device B**: Press home button (app goes to background)
3. **Device A**: Send message
4. **Device B**: 
   - [ ] System notification appears
   - [ ] Sound plays
   - [ ] Device vibrates
5. **Device B**: Tap notification
   - [ ] App comes to foreground
   - [ ] Navigates to chat
   - [ ] Message is visible

#### Test Scenario 2: App Completely Closed
1. **Device A**: Open app, go to chat
2. **Device B**: Force close app (swipe up in app switcher)
3. **Device A**: Send message
4. **Device B**:
   - [ ] System notification appears
   - [ ] Sound plays
   - [ ] Device vibrates
5. **Device B**: Tap notification
   - [ ] App launches
   - [ ] Shows splash screen briefly
   - [ ] Navigates to chat
   - [ ] Message is visible

#### Test Scenario 3: Multiple Notifications
1. **Device B**: Close app
2. **Device A**: Send 3 messages quickly
3. **Device B**:
   - [ ] Multiple notifications appear (or grouped)
   - [ ] Tap any notification
   - [ ] Opens chat with all messages visible

#### Test Scenario 4: DND/Silent Mode
1. **Device B**: Enable Do Not Disturb
2. **Device A**: Send message
3. **Device B**:
   - [ ] Notification appears silently (no sound/vibration)
   - [ ] Still added to notification center
   - [ ] Tap still works

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No Notifications in Background

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Notification permission not granted**
   - Check: Device Settings → App → Notifications
   - Fix: Enable notifications for the app

2. **Expo Push Token not saved**
   - Check: Firestore → users/{userId} → fcmTokens array
   - Fix: Logout and login again to re-register

3. **Battery optimization (Android)**
   - Check: Device Settings → Battery → Battery Optimization
   - Fix: Disable optimization for the app

4. **App not registered properly**
   - Check: Console logs for "Expo Push Token: ExponentPushToken[...]"
   - Fix: Uninstall and reinstall app

### Issue: Notification Sound Not Playing

**iOS:**
- Check: Device is not in silent mode
- Check: Settings → Notifications → App → Sounds is enabled

**Android:**
- Check: Settings → Apps → App → Notifications → Default channel → Sound
- Check: Device volume is not at zero

### Issue: Tapping Notification Doesn't Open Chat

**Check:**
1. Notification data includes `conversationId` and `screen`
2. Navigation ref is properly set up in App.tsx
3. App doesn't crash on launch (check logs)

**Fix:**
- Ensure notification data structure is correct:
  ```javascript
  {
    screen: 'Chat',
    conversationId: 'abc123',
    senderId: 'def456'
  }
  ```

## Limitations (Expo Go)

When testing with **Expo Go** (development):
- ✅ Foreground notifications work perfectly
- ✅ Background notifications work
- ⚠️ Some advanced features may not work (e.g., notification actions)
- ⚠️ Notification icon on Android uses Expo Go icon, not your app icon

**Solution:** Use **EAS Build** for production to get full functionality:
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile production
eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

---

## Production Considerations

### 1. Notification Rate Limiting
- Expo free tier: No official limit, but be reasonable
- Don't spam users with too many notifications
- Implement user preferences for notification settings

### 2. Notification Persistence
- iOS: Notifications persist until cleared
- Android: Notifications persist until cleared
- Implement "mark all as read" to clear notifications

### 3. Grouped Notifications (Android)
For better UX, implement notification grouping:
```javascript
// In notificationService.ts
notification: {
  ...
  android: {
    channelId: 'default',
    groupId: conversationId, // Group by conversation
    groupSummary: false,
  }
}
```

### 4. Notification Actions
Add quick actions (reply, mark as read):
```javascript
notification: {
  ...
  categoryIdentifier: 'message',
}

// Define categories
await Notifications.setNotificationCategoryAsync('message', [
  {
    identifier: 'reply',
    buttonTitle: 'Reply',
    textInput: { submitButtonTitle: 'Send', placeholder: 'Type a message...' }
  },
  {
    identifier: 'mark_read',
    buttonTitle: 'Mark as Read',
  }
]);
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Don't Send Too Many Notifications
```javascript
// Bad: Send notification for every message
sendNotification(user, message);

// Good: Batch notifications or use smart grouping
if (!recentlySentNotification(user)) {
  sendNotification(user, message);
}
```

### 2. Respect User Preferences
```javascript
// Check if user has notifications enabled
if (user.notificationsEnabled) {
  sendNotification(user, message);
}
```

### 3. Include Relevant Data
```javascript
// Good: Include everything needed to navigate
data: {
  screen: 'Chat',
  conversationId: '123',
  senderId: '456',
  messageId: '789' // Optional: scroll to specific message
}
```

### 4. Handle Notification Expiry
```javascript
// Set expiry time (24 hours)
notification: {
  ...
  expiration: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 86400, // 24 hours
}
```
