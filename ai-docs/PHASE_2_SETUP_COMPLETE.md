## 📝 Prompts Ready for Implementation

All prompts for AI features are in `docs/REMOTE_TEAM_PROFESSIONAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md`:

### Thread Summarization Prompt (Page 12)
```typescript
const SUMMARIZATION_PROMPT = `
You are an AI assistant helping a distributed software engineering team stay synchronized.

Analyze the following conversation between team members and provide a concise summary focusing on:
1. KEY DECISIONS: What was decided?
2. ACTION ITEMS: Who needs to do what by when?
3. BLOCKERS: Any issues preventing progress?
4. TECHNICAL DETAILS: Important technical context
5. NEXT STEPS: What happens next?

CONVERSATION:
{messages}

Provide a summary in this exact format: ...
`;
```

### Action Item Extraction Prompt (Page 20)
```typescript
const ACTION_ITEM_PROMPT = `
You are an AI assistant helping track action items for a software engineering team.

Analyze the following conversation and extract ALL action items.

For each action item, identify:
1. Task: What needs to be done?
2. Assignee: Who is responsible?
3. Deadline: When is it due?
4. Priority: High, Medium, or Low
5. Message ID: Which message mentioned this?

Return as JSON array: ...
`;
```

### Priority Detection Prompt (Page 35)
```typescript
const PRIORITY_DETECTION_PROMPT = `
Analyze this message and classify its urgency/priority:

MESSAGE: {messageContent}

CONTEXT: This is a work chat for a software engineering team

Return ONLY one word: "high", "medium", or "low"

PRIORITY LEVELS:
- high: Urgent, needs immediate attention (production down, security issue)
- medium: Important but not urgent (code review requests)
- low: General updates, casual chat
`;
```

**All other prompts** (semantic search, decision tracking, scheduling agent) are in the implementation guide.
