## ✅ **What Was Fixed**

### **1. Signup Form Keyboard Scrolling** ✅

**Problem**: Form gets squeezed when keyboard opens, fields not scrollable

**Fix**: Removed duplicate `KeyboardAvoidingView` from `SignupForm.tsx`

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/auth/SignupForm.tsx`
  - Removed `KeyboardAvoidingView` wrapper (parent already has one)
  - Removed unused `Platform` import
  - Removed `container` style

**Result**: Form now scrolls properly when keyboard is open ✅

## 📝 **That's It!**

**No other changes made**. Keeping it simple and stable.

## 🚀 **Build & Test**

```powershell
npx expo run:android --variant release
```

**Test**:
1. Open signup screen
2. Tap "Confirm Password" field
3. Keyboard opens
4. **Expected**: Form scrolls up, all fields visible ✅

## 📋 **Known Issues** (Not fixing now):

1. **Group/Conversation Sync**: 
   - Remove member works for groups table
