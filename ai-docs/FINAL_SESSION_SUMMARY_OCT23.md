## 📝 **Known Minor Issues** (Non-critical):

1. **Group sync**: Add/remove member updates groups table only
   - **Workaround**: Run sync script or manual Firestore update
   - **Not blocking**: Core features work fine

2. **Some performance optimizations reverted**:
   - Kept stable code over risky optimizations
   - App is fast and reliable as-is

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Test thoroughly** - All 6 AI features
2. **Record demo video** - Showcase features
3. **Submit** - Code + video + documentation
