## Timeline Tracking ⏱️

### Planned vs. Actual
| Phase | Planned | Actual | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|--------|
| Planning & PRD | 0-1 hours | 1 hour | ✅ Complete |
| Environment Setup | 1-2 hours | - | 🔜 Pending |
| Authentication | 2-3 hours | - | 🔜 Pending |
| Core Messaging Data | 3-6 hours | - | 🔜 Pending |
| Core Messaging UI | 6-9 hours | - | 🔜 Pending |
| Essential Features | 9-12 hours | - | 🔜 Pending |
| Group Chat | 12-15 hours | - | 🔜 Pending |
| Push Notifications | 15-17 hours | - | 🔜 Pending |
| AI Features | 17-22 hours | - | 🔜 Pending |
| Testing & Fixes | 22-24 hours | - | 🔜 Pending |
| Deployment | 24 hours | - | 🔜 Pending |

---

## Risk Status 🎯

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation Status |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| Firebase setup complexity | Medium | Mitigation planned (follow quickstart) |
| Push notifications not working | Medium | Mitigation: Focus on foreground only |
| AI features take too long | Medium | Mitigation: Implement simplest versions first |
| Real-time sync issues | Low | Mitigation: Use Firestore built-in |
| TestFlight review delay | Medium | Mitigation: Submit by hour 18-20 |

---

## Next Session Priorities 🎯

1. **Review and approve PRD** with user
2. **Set up development environment** (Xcode, Firebase, iOS project)
3. **Implement authentication** (login/signup)
4. **Begin core messaging** (data models, basic UI)

---

## Notes

- **Velocity Expectation**: MVP is ambitious for 24 hours. If falling behind, prioritize:
  1. Core messaging reliability (most important)
  2. Basic AI features (3 minimum)
  3. Group chat (nice-to-have but required for MVP)
  4. Push notifications (foreground only for MVP)

- **Quality Over Features**: Better to have 3 rock-solid features than 10 half-working features

- **Testing Early**: Don't wait until hour 22 to test on real devices

- **Firebase First**: Get Firebase working early (auth, Firestore). It's the foundation for everything else.
