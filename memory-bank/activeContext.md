## Current Focus

### Just Completed (October 22, 2025)

#### **PR #15: AWS Infrastructure Setup (Tasks 15.1 & 15.2 COMPLETE ✅)**

**Task 15.1: AWS OpenSearch Cluster Setup ✅**
- ✅ Created OpenSearch domain: `pigeonai-embeddings`
  - Version: OpenSearch 3.1 (latest)
  - Deployment: Easy create, 3-node Multi-AZ cluster
  - Network: Public access, IPv4 only
  - Instance: t3.small.search (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM) × 3 nodes
  - Storage: 10GB EBS per node (30GB total)
  - Endpoint: `https://search-pigeonai-embeddings-sefdb6usfwni6dhjxdmoqsn7zi.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com`
  - Access: Public with HTTP basic auth
  - Credentials: admin / PigeonAI2025!
- ✅ Created index: `message_embeddings`
  - k-NN enabled for vector search
  - Mapping: `embedding` field with type `knn_vector` (1536 dimensions)
  - Method: HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)
  - Engine: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) - optimized for OpenSearch 3.x
  - Distance metric: Cosine similarity
  - Shards: 1 primary, 2 replicas (3 total copies for Multi-AZ)
- ✅ Tested vector search functionality
  - Created `aws-lambda/opensearch/create-index.js` (index creation script)
  - Created `aws-lambda/opensearch/test-vector-search.js` (test script)
  - Created `aws-lambda/opensearch/README.md` (documentation)
  - Index created successfully, ready for embeddings
- **Key Learnings**:
  - OpenSearch 3.x requires FAISS engine (nmslib deprecated)
  - Multi-AZ requires replicas = nodes - 1 (2 replicas for 3-node cluster)
  - Easy create with IPv6 dual-stack fails due to subnet issues → use IPv4 only

**Task 15.2: AWS ElastiCache Redis Setup ✅**
- ✅ Created ElastiCache Serverless Valkey cache: `pigeonai-cache`
  - Engine: Valkey 8 (open-source Redis alternative, recommended by AWS)
  - Deployment: Serverless (auto-scaling, pay-per-use)
  - Endpoint: `pigeonai-cache-ggng2r.serverless.use1.cache.amazonaws.com:6379`
  - Encryption: In-transit enabled, at-rest with AWS KMS
  - Security: Default security group with port 6379 inbound rule (0.0.0.0/0)
  - No password required (serverless default)
- ✅ Configured security group
  - Added inbound rule: Custom TCP, port 6379, source 0.0.0.0/0
  - Allows Lambda access from anywhere in AWS
- ✅ Created Redis client code
  - `aws-lambda/redis/redisClient.js` (Redis client with auto-TTL)
  - `aws-lambda/redis/test-cache.js` (comprehensive test suite)
  - `aws-lambda/redis/package.json` (dependencies: ioredis v5.4.1)
  - `aws-lambda/redis/README.md` (setup guide, usage examples)
  - `aws-lambda/redis/TESTING.md` (testing instructions)
- ✅ TTL Configuration
  - Summaries: 1 hour (3600s)
  - Action Items: 2 hours (7200s)
  - Search Results: 30 minutes (1800s)
  - Decisions: 2 hours (7200s)
  - Priority: 1 hour (3600s)
  - Meeting: 2 hours (7200s)
- ✅ Dependencies installed
  - `npm install` in `aws-lambda/redis/` completed
  - `ioredis` package installed successfully
- **Key Learnings**:
  - ElastiCache endpoints only accessible from within AWS (not local computer)
  - Local test fails with ENOTFOUND (expected, will work from Lambda)
  - Serverless Valkey is better than traditional Redis (auto-scaling, pay-per-use, ~$3-5/month vs $13/month)
  - No password authentication required for Serverless Valkey

**Files Created**:
- `aws-lambda/opensearch/create-index.js`
- `aws-lambda/opensearch/test-vector-search.js`
- `aws-lambda/opensearch/README.md`
- `docs/TASK_15.1_COMPLETION_GUIDE.md`
- `aws-lambda/redis/redisClient.js`
- `aws-lambda/redis/test-cache.js`
- `aws-lambda/redis/package.json`
- `aws-lambda/redis/README.md`
- `aws-lambda/redis/TESTING.md`

**Next**: Task 15.3 - Create API Gateway REST API

### Push Notifications (PR #10) - AWS Lambda System
- **Production Architecture**:
  - AWS Lambda handles all push notifications server-side
  - API Gateway exposes Lambda endpoint for React Native app
  - Lambda uses Firebase Admin SDK to send FCM notifications
  - React Native app calls Lambda after sending message to Firestore
  - Avoids Firebase Cloud Functions (requires Blaze plan)
  - Free solution using AWS Lambda + Firebase Spark plan
- **Token Management**:
  - FCM tokens generated in APK using `expo-notifications`
  - Fallback to Expo Push Tokens if FCM unavailable
  - Tokens stored in Firestore (`users/{userId}/fcmTokens`)
  - Lambda reads tokens and sends to all recipients
  - Invalid tokens automatically removed by Lambda
- **Notification Format**:
  - **DM**: "User Name: message"
  - **Group**: "Group Name - User Name: message"
  - Truncates messages longer than 100 characters
  - Works in foreground, background, and closed states
- **Global Notification Listener**:
  - Single listener for all conversations
  - Tracks last seen message per conversation
  - Only notifies for new messages from others
  - Works anywhere in the app (not just in chat)
- **Missed Message Notifications**:
  - Checks for messages received while offline
  - Notifies when user comes online
  - Prevents spam on first login/reload
- **Documentation**:
  - AWS Lambda setup guide (`docs/AWS_LAMBDA_SETUP.md`)
  - Notification system explained (`docs/NOTIFICATION_SYSTEM_COMPLETE.md`)
  - Hybrid local/remote system for development

### Performance Optimizations
- **Zero Duplicate Messages**: Advanced deduplication with `useRef` tracking
- **Zero Message Jitter**: Inverted FlatList with proper scroll handling
- **Cache-First Loading**: Instant display from SQLite, background sync
- **User Profile Caching**: Global cache prevents "Unknown User" flashes
- **Thread-Safe SQLite**: Operation queue prevents concurrency errors
- **Real-Time Updates**: Read receipts, typing indicators, presence all update live
- **Optimized Scrolling**: Empty state mirroring fixed for inverted lists
- **Clean Console**: Removed debug logs, only essential production logs remain

### UI/UX Enhancements
- **Logo in Header**: App icon displayed beside "Pigeon" in ConversationListScreen
- **Expandable FAB Menu**: 
  - Main FAB with `+` icon
  - Expands to show "New Chat" and "New Group" buttons
  - Icons and labels for clarity
  - Semi-transparent overlay when open
- **Group Details Screen**:
  - Tappable header in group chats
  - Shows group info and member list
  - Admin badges for group admins
  - Clickable members (others → User Details, self → Settings)
  - "(You)" beside current user's name
  - Leave Group button
- **Keyboard Handling**:
  - `KeyboardAvoidingView` on ChatScreen, CreateGroupScreen, LoginScreen, SignupScreen
  - Proper offset for iOS/Android
  - Smooth keyboard interactions
- **Message Timestamps**:
  - Now show date AND time
  - "Yesterday 2:30 PM" instead of just "Yesterday"
  - "Jan 15 2:30 PM" for older messages
  - Consistent time display across all messages

## Technical Learnings from Recent Work

### Push Notifications
1. **Expo Go Limitations (SDK 53+)**: Remote push notifications don't work in Expo Go
   - Requires EAS Build or Expo Dev Client for full push notification testing
   - Solution: Hybrid system with local notifications for development
2. **Global vs. Per-Conversation Listeners**: 
   - Initially had notification logic in `useMessages` (per-conversation)
   - Moved to global `useGlobalNotifications` hook for app-wide coverage
   - Prevents duplicate listeners, ensures notifications work anywhere
3. **Preventing Notification Spam**:
   - Must mark existing messages as "seen" on initialization
   - Use `processedMessageIds` ref to track notified messages
   - Timestamp-based filtering for "missed messages"
   - Flag to prevent checks on initial app load
4. **Firebase Message Limit**: Default `getMessages` limit is 50
   - Can cause notification spam if user has >50 messages
   - Solution: Fetch all messages (`limit: 9999`) during initialization
5. **Silent Error Handling**: Expo Go shows errors for unavailable features
   - Must silently catch and ignore errors for better UX
   - `LogBox.ignoreLogs()` for in-app yellow warnings
   - Custom console filters for terminal output

### Group Chat
1. **Group Creation Validation**: Ensure at least 3 total members (creator + 2 others)
2. **Admin Management**: First creator is admin, can add/remove members
3. **Typing in Groups**: Show names of who's typing, with smart formatting
   - 1 user: "John is messaging"
   - 2 users: "John and Sarah are messaging"
   - 3+ users: "3 people are messaging"
4. **Group Details Navigation**: Tappable headers provide access to group/user info
5. **User Profile Access**: Different navigation based on user (self → Settings, others → User Details)

### Scrolling and Message Display
1. **Inverted FlatList**: Standard pattern for chat apps
   - Newest messages at bottom (natural)
   - Oldest at top (scroll up to see more)
   - Requires reversing array and mirroring empty state
2. **Empty State Mirroring**: Must apply both `scaleY: -1` and `scaleX: -1` to prevent horizontal flip
3. **Scroll to End**: Use `scrollToEnd()` with inverted list, not `scrollToOffset(0)`
4. **Optimistic Updates**: Insert at beginning of array for inverted list: `[optimisticMessage, ...prev]`

### Real-Time Updates
1. **Message Update Detection**: Must compare entire `readBy` object and `status` field
   - Not just check for new messages
   - Update existing messages when their fields change
2. **Firestore Listener Efficiency**: Compare before/after state to detect actual changes
3. **useEffect Dependency Arrays**: Stabilize with `useRef` to prevent listener churn

## Visual Design

### Header Status Priority (Chat)
1. 🔵 **messaging • • •** ← Animated dots, primary color, italic (when typing)
2. 🟢 **Online** ← Green dot + "Online" text
3. ⏰ **Last seen 5m ago** ← Relative time
4. ⚫ **Offline** ← Default state

### Typing Animation
- 3 dots bouncing in sequence (0ms, 200ms, 400ms delay)
- Opacity: 0.4 → 1.0
- Duration: 400ms per cycle
- Uses `useNativeDriver: true` for 60fps performance

### Group Typing Display
- 1 user: "John is messaging • • •"
- 2 users: "John and Sarah are messaging • • •"
- 3+ users: "3 people are messaging • • •"

### FAB Menu
- Main FAB: Primary color, `+` icon (rotates to `×` when open)
- Secondary FABs: 
  - "New Chat" with chat bubble icon
  - "New Group" with people icon
  - Labels beside icons
- Semi-transparent overlay when open
- Smooth animations for expand/collapse

### Message Timestamps
- **Today**: `2:30 PM` (time only)
- **Yesterday**: `Yesterday 2:30 PM`
- **This year**: `Jan 15 2:30 PM`
- **Other years**: `Jan 15 2023 2:30 PM`
