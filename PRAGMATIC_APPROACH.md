# Pragmatic Approach - Proactive Assistant

## 🤔 **Reality Check**

**Full redesign** (detecting multiple threads, new UI, etc.): **3-4 hours**  
**Time remaining**: Limited  
**Risk**: High (lots of new code, testing needed)

---

## ✅ **Better Approach: Enhance Current Feature**

Keep the current scheduling agent but make these KEY improvements:

### **1. Better Intent Detection** (30 min)
- Detect more keywords
- Scan more of the conversation (not just last 10 messages)
- Better confidence scoring

### **2. Better Date/Time Extraction** (30 min)
- Handle "Dec 2", "tomorrow", "next week"
- Handle "2 PM", "morning", "afternoon"
- Show what was detected in UI

### **3. Fix UI Issues** (30 min)
- ✅ Remove white backgrounds
- ✅ Show date/time extraction results
- ✅ Remove Google Calendar integration
- ✅ Simple "Confirm" button

### **4. Better Time Suggestions** (15 min)
- Vary based on detected date/time
- If they said "Dec 2 morning" → Suggest morning times on Dec 2
- If vague → Suggest next few days
