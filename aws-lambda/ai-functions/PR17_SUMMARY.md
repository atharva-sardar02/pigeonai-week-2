# PR #17: Action Item Extraction - COMPLETE âœ…

**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Feature**: AI-powered action item extraction with structured output  
**Status**: Implementation complete, ready for deployment

---

## Summary

Implemented action item extraction feature that identifies tasks, assignments, and to-dos from conversations with:
- **Task descriptions**: Clear, actionable items
- **Assignees**: @mentions or context-based assignment
- **Deadlines**: Parsed from natural language ("by Friday", "EOD", etc.)
- **Priority levels**: High/Medium/Low based on urgency indicators
- **Dependencies**: Tasks that depend on other tasks
- **Context**: Why the task exists

---

## What Was Built

### Backend (AWS Lambda)

1. **âœ… Lambda Function** (`aws-lambda/ai-functions/actionItems.js`)
   - Fetches messages from Firestore
   - Extracts action items using OpenAI GPT-4 with JSON mode
   - Implements Redis caching (2 hour TTL)
   - Returns structured JSON with breakdown stats
   - Error handling and validation

2. **âœ… Prompt Template** (`aws-lambda/ai-functions/prompts/actionItems.js`)
   - Persona-specific for Remote Team Professional
   - Structured JSON output with all fields
   - Deadline parsing (relative â†’ absolute dates)
   - Priority rules (urgent â†’ high, important â†’ medium, etc.)
   - Dependency detection

3. **âœ… Router** (`aws-lambda/ai-functions/index.js`)
   - Routes `/ai/extract-action-items` requests to action items handler
   - Replaces placeholder 501 response

### Frontend (React Native)

4. **âœ… ActionItem Model** (`src/models/ActionItem.ts`)
   - TypeScript interfaces for ActionItem and ActionItemResponse
   - Helper functions:
     - `formatDeadline()` - Display deadlines with urgency
     - `getUrgency()` - Calculate overdue/urgent/normal
     - `sortActionItems()` - Priority + deadline sorting
     - `filterActionItems()` - Filter by status/assignment
   - Priority colors, labels, and icons

5. **âœ… ActionItemsList Component** (`src/components/ai/ActionItemsList.tsx`)
   - Full-screen modal with filtered action items
   - Priority color coding (ðŸ”´ high, ðŸŸ¡ medium, ðŸŸ¢ low)
   - Deadline badges with urgency indicators
   - Filter buttons: All / Mine / Active / Done
   - Stats display: Total, High Priority, Completed
   - Mark as complete checkbox
   - Navigate to source message button
   - Loading and error states

6. **âœ… ChatHeader Integration** (`src/components/chat/ChatHeader.tsx`)
   - Added checkbox icon button for action items
   - Positioned next to summarize button
   - Conditionally shown based on `onExtractActionItems` prop

7. **âœ… ChatScreen Integration** (`src/screens/main/ChatScreen.tsx`)
   - Connected ActionItemsList modal
   - Implemented `handleExtractActionItems` function
   - Integrated with aiService
   - Mark as complete functionality (local state)
   - Navigate to message handler (placeholder)

### Infrastructure

8. **âœ… Constants Update** (`src/utils/constants.ts`)
   - Added `successLight`, `warningLight`, `errorLight` colors
   - Used for deadline urgency badges

**Low Priority** (ðŸŸ¢):
- Keywords: "when you have time", "nice to have", "eventually", "someday"
- Context: Nice-to-haves, no deadline mentioned

## Sample Test Conversation

Create a conversation with these messages:

```
[10:00] Alex: Hey team, we need to finalize the sprint tasks
[10:02] Mike: Can someone review my database refactoring PR? It's urgent
[10:03] Sarah: I can review it by end of day
[10:05] Alex: @John, can you deploy the staging environment for QA testing?
[10:07] John: Sure, when do they need it?
[10:08] Alex: By Thursday morning
[10:10] Mike: Don't forget we need to update the API documentation
[10:12] Sarah: I'll take that. Should be done by next Monday
[10:15] Alex: @Mike, after Sarah's review, please merge and deploy to production
[10:17] Mike: Got it. Friday afternoon work for deployment?
[10:18] Alex: Perfect
[10:20] John: Oh, I also need to fix that bug in the auth service
[10:22] Alex: How urgent is that?
[10:23] John: Pretty urgent - users are reporting login issues
[10:25] Alex: Drop the staging deployment, fix the auth bug first
[10:27] John: On it
```

**Expected Output**:
- 8 action items total
- 2 high priority (urgent PR review, auth bug fix)
- 4 medium priority (staging deployment, production deploy, etc.)
- 2 low priority (API docs)
- 6 assigned, 2 unassigned

## Next Steps

After deploying summarization + action items:
- **PR #18**: Semantic Search + RAG (3-4 hours)
- **PR #19**: Priority Detection (3 hours)
- **PR #20**: Decision Tracking (3-4 hours)
- **PR #21**: Scheduling Agent (5-6 hours)

Then **single deployment** with all AI features!
