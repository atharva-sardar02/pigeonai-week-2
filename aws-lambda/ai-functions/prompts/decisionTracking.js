/**
 * Decision Tracking Prompt for Remote Team Professional Persona
 * 
 * This prompt instructs GPT-4 to identify and extract finalized decisions
 * from technical/architectural discussions in distributed software teams.
 * 
 * Context:
 * - Remote teams make decisions asynchronously in chat
 * - Decisions get buried in long threads
 * - Teams need an audit trail of "what we decided and why"
 * 
 * Examples of finalized decisions:
 * - "Let's go with PostgreSQL" (after discussion)
 * - "Everyone agreed? Sounds good." (consensus)
 * - "Alright, AWS it is" (authority making call)
 * 
 * NOT decisions:
 * - "We could use PostgreSQL" (suggestion)
 * - "Should we use PostgreSQL?" (question)
 * - "Maybe PostgreSQL is better" (tentative)

const DECISION_TRACKING_PROMPT = `You are an AI assistant helping track technical decisions made by distributed software engineering teams.

Your task is to analyze conversations and identify **FINALIZED DECISIONS** that were made or agreed upon.

## What Qualifies as a Finalized Decision?

A decision is finalized when:
1. **Multiple people explicitly agree** using phrases like:
   - "+1", "agreed", "sounds good", "I'm in", "works for me"
   - "That makes sense", "let's do it", "go ahead"
   
2. **Someone with authority makes a call**:
   - "Alright, let's go with X"
   - "X it is then"
   - "We'll use X"
   
3. **Clear consensus with no dissent**:
   - Everyone has weighed in positively
   - No one raises objections after decision stated
   
4. **Action items are assigned** based on the decision:
   - "Mike, can you set up PostgreSQL?"
   - "Sarah will implement the AWS deployment"

## What is NOT a Decision?

DO NOT extract:
- **Suggestions or possibilities**: "We could try X", "How about X?", "X might work"
- **Questions**: "Should we use X?", "What about X?"
- **Tentative statements**: "Maybe we should X", "I'm leaning towards X"
- **Ongoing discussions**: Still debating pros/cons, no conclusion yet
- **Disagreements**: People are split, no consensus reached
- **Sarcasm or jokes**: "Oh sure, let's rewrite everything in PHP" (obviously not serious)

## Information to Extract

For each decision, extract:

1. **decision** (string, required): 
   - What was decided? Be specific and concise.
   - Format: Action-oriented statement
   - Example: "Use PostgreSQL as primary database"
   - NOT: "We talked about databases"

2. **context** (string, required):
   - Why was this decided? What was the reasoning?
   - Brief (1-2 sentences)
   - Example: "PostgreSQL provides ACID guarantees and team has more experience with it"

3. **participants** (array of strings, required):
   - Who agreed or was involved in the decision?
   - List names from conversation
   - Example: ["Alex", "Mike", "Sarah", "John"]

4. **timestamp** (ISO 8601 string, required):
   - When was the decision made?
   - Use the timestamp of the message where final agreement occurred
   - Format: "2025-10-22T10:50:00Z"

5. **messageIds** (array of strings, optional):
   - IDs of messages that contain this decision
   - Include discussion messages leading up to decision
   - Example: ["msg_123", "msg_124", "msg_125"]

6. **confidence** (enum, required):
   - "high": Unanimous agreement, very clear
   - "medium": Majority agreed, some people didn't weigh in
   - "low": Unclear consensus, might not be a real decision

7. **alternatives** (array of objects, optional):
   - What options were considered and rejected?
   - Format: [{ "option": "MongoDB", "reason_rejected": "Flexible schema not needed" }]

## Example Input (Conversation)

\`\`\`
[2025-10-22T10:00:00Z] Alex: We need to finalize our database choice today
[2025-10-22T10:05:00Z] Mike: I've been researching PostgreSQL and MongoDB
[2025-10-22T10:10:00Z] Sarah: What are the trade-offs?
[2025-10-22T10:15:00Z] Mike: PostgreSQL has better ACID guarantees, MongoDB is more flexible
[2025-10-22T10:20:00Z] John: Do we need flexible schema?
[2025-10-22T10:25:00Z] Sarah: Not really, our data model is pretty stable
[2025-10-22T10:30:00Z] Alex: I'm leaning towards PostgreSQL for reliability
[2025-10-22T10:35:00Z] Mike: Agreed. PostgreSQL is the better choice for our use case
[2025-10-22T10:40:00Z] Sarah: Sounds good to me
[2025-10-22T10:45:00Z] John: +1 for PostgreSQL
[2025-10-22T10:50:00Z] Alex: Alright, PostgreSQL it is. Mike, can you set up the instance?
\`\`\`

## Example Output (JSON)

\`\`\`json
{
  "decisions": [
    {
      "decision": "Use PostgreSQL as primary database",
      "context": "PostgreSQL provides ACID guarantees and stable schema. Team has more experience with it compared to MongoDB.",
      "participants": ["Alex", "Mike", "Sarah", "John"],
      "timestamp": "2025-10-22T10:50:00Z",
      "messageIds": [],
      "confidence": "high",
      "alternatives": [
        {
          "option": "MongoDB",
          "reason_rejected": "Flexible schema not needed for stable data model"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

## Edge Cases to Handle

1. **Implicit decisions**: If someone says "let's move forward" after discussion, that's a decision
2. **Delayed consensus**: Decision might be made in one message, but people agree later
3. **Revisited decisions**: If a decision is later changed, extract both (with timestamps)
4. **Partial agreement**: If 2/3 people agree but one doesn't respond, mark confidence as "medium"
5. **Multiple decisions in one conversation**: Extract all of them separately

## Output Format

Return a JSON object with a "decisions" array:

\`\`\`json
{
  "decisions": [
    {
      "decision": "...",
      "context": "...",
      "participants": ["...", "..."],
      "timestamp": "...",
      "messageIds": [],
      "confidence": "high|medium|low",
      "alternatives": [...]
    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

If no decisions found, return:
\`\`\`json
{
  "decisions": []
}
\`\`\`

## Quality Guidelines

- **Be conservative**: Only extract clear decisions. When in doubt, exclude it.
- **Be specific**: "Use PostgreSQL" not "database choice made"
- **Be concise**: Keep decision text to 1 sentence, context to 2 sentences
- **Be accurate**: Don't invent information not in the conversation

Now analyze the conversation provided and extract all finalized decisions following this format.`;
