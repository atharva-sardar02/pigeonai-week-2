**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Project Timeline**: 7 days (MVP due in 24 hours)  
**Project Type**: Cross-Platform Messaging Application with AI Features

---

## Executive Summary

Pigeon AI is a real-time messaging platform built with React Native and Firebase. The MVP focuses exclusively on building rock-solid messaging infrastructure: one-on-one chat, group messaging, real-time sync, offline support, and push notifications. **AI features and persona selection will come AFTER the MVP is complete.**

**Core Value Proposition**: A messaging app that works flawlessly anywhere (online, offline, poor connection). WhatsApp-like reliability with modern React Native architecture.

**MVP Philosophy**: Messaging infrastructure first. AI features second. A simple, reliable messaging app beats any feature-rich app with flaky message delivery.

# POST-MVP FEATURES

Everything below this line is **NOT** part of the MVP. These will be added after the core messaging infrastructure is proven reliable.

---

## Phase 2: Persona Selection & AI Features (Post-MVP)

### Persona Options

After MVP is complete, we'll choose **ONE** persona and build AI features for them:

1. **Remote Team Professional** - Thread summarization, action items, decision tracking, smart search, proactive scheduling
2. **International Communicator** - Real-time translation, language detection, cultural context, formality adjustment
3. **Busy Parent/Caregiver** - Calendar extraction, decision summarization, priority highlighting, RSVP tracking
4. **Content Creator/Influencer** - Auto-categorization, response drafting, FAQ auto-responder, sentiment analysis

Each persona requires **5 core AI features + 1 advanced feature** (multi-step agent or context-aware smart replies).

### AI Implementation (Post-MVP)

**Not building this in MVP.** After messaging works perfectly:
1. Choose persona based on team interest and user feedback
2. Design AI features specific to that persona
3. Implement Cloud Functions for AI endpoints
4. Build AI assistant interface (dedicated chat or contextual UI)
5. Integrate OpenAI/Claude with RAG pipeline
6. Test AI features thoroughly

## Technical Considerations & Potential Pitfalls

### 1. Real-Time Sync Challenges

**Challenge**: Messages must appear instantly (<1 second latency) while handling offline scenarios gracefully.

**Considerations**:
- **Firestore Limitations**: Firestore listeners are excellent for real-time updates, but understand the pricing model (reads/writes/deletes). Each listener snapshot counts as a read.
- **WebSocket Management**: If using custom backend, WebSocket connections can drop. Implement exponential backoff reconnection strategy.
- **Offline Queue**: Messages sent while offline must queue locally and sync when connection returns. Handle partial send failures.
- **Message Ordering**: Ensure messages appear in correct chronological order even with network delays. Use server-side timestamps, not client timestamps.
- **Conflict Resolution**: What happens if two messages are sent simultaneously? Server timestamp should be source of truth.

**Mitigation**:
- Use Firestore's built-in offline persistence
- Implement optimistic UI updates with rollback on failure
- Display clear message status indicators
- Test extensively with airplane mode and network throttling

### 2. Message Delivery Reliability

**Challenge**: Zero message loss‚Äîevery message must eventually deliver, even through app crashes.

**Considerations**:
- **Optimistic Updates Gone Wrong**: User sends message, app crashes before server confirms. On restart, message must still send.
- **Duplicate Messages**: Network retries could cause duplicate sends. Use idempotency keys or unique message IDs.
- **Delivery Confirmation**: How do we track that a message was delivered to recipient's device vs. stored on server?
- **Read Receipts**: Should read receipts update in real-time? What if user is viewing chat but not focused on latest message?

**Mitigation**:
- Persist messages to local database **before** showing in UI
- Use unique client-generated message IDs
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Use Firestore transactions for critical writes
- Add "delivery" collection to track which devices have received which messages

### 3. Offline Support Complexity

**Challenge**: App must work smoothly offline, then sync when connectivity returns.

**Considerations**:
- **Offline Writes**: Messages sent offline must persist locally and sync later
- **Stale Data**: User views offline data, goes online‚Äîhow do we merge remote updates?
- **Storage Limits**: How much chat history do we store locally? What if user has 10,000 messages?
- **Sync Conflicts**: User sends message offline, recipient also sends message offline‚Äîhow do we merge?

**Mitigation**:
- Use Firestore's offline persistence (handles most of this automatically)
- Implement data pruning strategy (keep last 30 days locally, fetch older messages on demand)
- Clear visual indicators when in offline mode
- Test offline-to-online transition extensively

### 4. Push Notification Challenges

**Challenge**: Notifications must work reliably on iOS, including background and killed states.

**Considerations**:
- **APNs Complexity**: Apple Push Notification service requires proper certificate setup
- **iOS Background Restrictions**: Notification delivery when app is terminated requires FCM or APNs
- **Silent Push**: May want silent push to sync messages in background (iOS limits this)
- **Notification Payload Size**: Limited to 4KB
- **Permission Handling**: User might deny notification permissions

**Mitigation**:
- Use Firebase Cloud Messaging (abstracts APNs complexity)
- Request notification permissions at appropriate time (not on app launch)
- Implement fallback: if user denies notifications, show in-app alert for new messages
- For MVP, focus on foreground notifications first
- Test on physical device (simulator doesn't support real push notifications)

### 5. AI Feature Performance & Latency (POST-MVP)

**Note**: AI features are NOT in MVP. This consideration applies to post-MVP phases.

**Challenge**: AI responses (GPT-4, Claude) can take 2-10 seconds, impacting user experience.

**Considerations**:
- **User Expectations**: Users expect instant messaging. AI features that take 5+ seconds feel slow.
- **Cost**: Each AI API call costs money. A user asking "Summarize my last 100 messages" could cost $0.10-0.50 per request.
- **Rate Limits**: OpenAI API has rate limits. Exceeding them causes failures.
- **Context Length**: GPT-4 has context limits (128K tokens). Summarizing a 500-message thread might exceed this.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Bad prompts = bad results. Needs iteration.

**Mitigation**:
- Show loading indicators for AI operations
- Implement caching: cache summaries for 1 hour, regenerate if new messages arrive
- Use streaming responses where possible (text appears progressively)
- Rate limit users: max 10 AI requests per minute per user
- Implement token counting before API calls to prevent exceeding limits
- Use cheaper models (GPT-3.5) for simple tasks, GPT-4 for complex reasoning
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff for API failures

### 6. RAG Pipeline Complexity (POST-MVP)

**Note**: RAG is NOT in MVP. This consideration applies to post-MVP AI features.

**Challenge**: AI agent needs access to user's conversation history to provide useful answers.

**Considerations**:
- **Data Volume**: User might have thousands of messages. Can't send all to LLM.
- **Embeddings**: Need to generate embeddings for messages, store in vector database, perform similarity search.
- **Latency**: Retrieval adds latency (search DB, fetch messages, send to LLM).
- **Accuracy**: Semantic search might not return the most relevant messages.
- **Privacy**: Sending messages to OpenAI might concern users (data privacy).

**Mitigation**:
- For MVP, use simple time-based retrieval (last N messages) instead of full vector search
- Limit context to 1000 messages (recent conversations)
- Implement basic keyword search first, add vector search later
- Be transparent about data privacy (include in terms of service)
- Consider running local LLMs (Llama 3, etc.) if privacy is critical (much harder, not for MVP)

### 7. Group Chat Complexity

**Challenge**: Group chats have N-to-N message delivery, increasing complexity.

**Considerations**:
- **Delivery Tracking**: With 5 group members, one message = 5 delivery receipts to track
- **Read Receipts**: Show "Read by 3/5" or individual checkmarks?
- **Typing Indicators**: If 3 people are typing, how do we display that?
- **Push Notifications**: Should every group message trigger a push? Can get spammy.
- **Message Ordering**: Even more critical in groups (multiple senders)

**Mitigation**:
- Simplify read receipts for MVP (just show if delivered, not per-person read status)
- Limit typing indicators to "Someone is typing..."
- Implement notification muting per conversation
- Use server-side timestamps for message ordering
- Test with 3-5 users in a group first, then scale

### 8. iOS-Specific Challenges

**Challenge**: iOS app lifecycle, memory management, and platform constraints.

**Considerations**:
- **React Native Bridge**: JavaScript <-> Native bridge can be slow for heavy operations
- **Expo Limitations**: Some native modules aren't available in Expo Go (require custom dev client)
- **App State Management**: Apps can be killed by OS, need to handle gracefully
- **Memory Management**: Large lists can cause performance issues without optimization
- **Platform Differences**: iOS and Android behave differently (notifications, permissions, storage)
- **Debugging Challenges**: Errors can be cryptic, especially with native modules

**Mitigation**:
- Use FlatList with virtualization for message lists (render only visible items)
- Implement AppState listeners to detect when app goes to background/foreground
- Use React Native Performance Monitor to identify bottlenecks
- Test on both iOS and Android physical devices early
- Use Expo Dev Client if need native modules not in Expo Go
- Keep most logic in JavaScript (minimize bridge calls)
- Use Hermes engine for better performance

### 9. Data Modeling & Database Schema

**Challenge**: Poor data model makes features hard to add later.

**Considerations**:
- **Message Model**: What fields? (id, senderId, recipientId, content, timestamp, status, type)
- **Group Messages**: How to model? Separate collection or same as DM?
- **Read Receipts**: Store per-user read status or just last read timestamp?
- **Conversation List**: How to efficiently query "all conversations for user X" with last message preview?
- **Deleted Messages**: Hard delete or soft delete (mark as deleted)?

**Mitigation**:
- Design Firestore schema upfront (see suggested schema below)
- Use subcollections for scalability
- Index strategically for common queries
- Plan for soft deletes (add `deleted: true` field)

**Suggested Firestore Schema**:
```
/users/{userId}
  - displayName, profilePictureUrl, bio, createdAt, lastSeen, isOnline

/conversations/{conversationId}
  - type: "dm" | "group"
  - participants: [userId1, userId2, ...]
  - lastMessage: {senderId, content, timestamp}
  - createdAt, updatedAt

/conversations/{conversationId}/messages/{messageId}
  - senderId, content, timestamp, type: "text" | "image"
  - status: "sending" | "sent" | "delivered" | "read"
  - readBy: {userId: timestamp, ...}

/groups/{groupId}
  - name, iconUrl, adminIds, memberIds, createdAt
```

### 10. Security Vulnerabilities

**Challenge**: Messaging apps are prime targets for security issues.

**Considerations**:
- **Authentication**: Weak auth = account takeover
- **Message Spoofing**: Can user A send a message claiming to be from user B?
- **API Keys**: Exposing OpenAI API key in client = unlimited spending
- **XSS/Injection**: If displaying user content, risk of script injection
- **IDOR**: Can user A read user B's private messages by guessing conversation IDs?

**Mitigation**:
- Use Firebase Auth (battle-tested)
- Validate sender on backend (use auth token)
- **Never** put API keys in mobile app‚Äîuse Cloud Functions
- Sanitize all user input before display
- Use Firestore Security Rules to enforce access control
- Never trust client-side data‚Äîvalidate on server

**Sample Firestore Security Rules**:
```javascript
match /conversations/{conversationId}/messages/{messageId} {
  allow read: if request.auth.uid in resource.data.participants;
  allow create: if request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.senderId;
}
```

### 11. Testing Scenarios (Critical for MVP)

**Challenge**: Messaging apps have complex state management. Need systematic testing.

**Testing Checklist**:
1. ‚úÖ Two devices chatting in real-time (messages appear within 1 second)
2. ‚úÖ User A sends message, User B is offline, User B comes online ‚Üí message delivers
3. ‚úÖ Send message, force quit app, reopen ‚Üí message sent
4. ‚úÖ Send 20 messages rapidly ‚Üí all deliver in order
5. ‚úÖ Airplane mode ‚Üí message queues ‚Üí exit airplane mode ‚Üí message sends
6. ‚úÖ Poor network (throttled to 3G) ‚Üí messages still deliver (just slower)
7. ‚úÖ Group chat with 3 users ‚Üí messages deliver to all
8. ‚úÖ Background app ‚Üí receive message ‚Üí push notification appears (production APK)
9. üü° AI command "Summarize conversation" ‚Üí returns summary within 10 seconds (post-MVP)
10. ‚úÖ Restart app ‚Üí chat history loads correctly

**Mitigation**:
- ‚úÖ Tested on two physical devices (Android + iOS)
- ‚úÖ Used network throttling tools to simulate poor networks
- ‚úÖ Tested in Expo Go for rapid iteration, then validated on production APK
- ‚úÖ Created test accounts: multiple users for group testing

### 12. Cost Management

**Challenge**: Firebase, OpenAI, and other services can get expensive if not monitored.

**Considerations**:
- **Firestore**: Reads/writes are billed. Real-time listeners can rack up reads quickly.
- **OpenAI API**: GPT-4 is $0.03/1K input tokens, $0.06/1K output tokens. Heavy usage = high costs.
- **Firebase Storage**: Image uploads consume storage and bandwidth.
- **Cloud Functions**: Billed per invocation and compute time.

**Mitigation**:
- Set up Firebase budget alerts ($50, $100)
- Cache AI responses aggressively
- Limit AI requests per user (10/minute, 100/day)
- Use GPT-3.5 Turbo instead of GPT-4 where possible (10x cheaper)
- Optimize Firestore queries (don't listen to entire collections)
- Implement pagination (don't load all messages at once)
- Monitor costs daily during development
