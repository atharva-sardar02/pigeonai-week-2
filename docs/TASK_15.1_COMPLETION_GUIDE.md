# Task 15.1 Completion Guide - AWS OpenSearch

**Status**: ⏳ Cluster is creating (10-15 minutes)  
**Next Steps**: After cluster becomes Active

---

## What You Just Did ✅

1. ✅ Created AWS OpenSearch domain: `pigeonai-embeddings`
2. ✅ Configuration:
   - Deployment: Multi-AZ with standby (3 nodes)
   - Instance: r6g.large.search
   - Storage: 100GB GP3 per node
   - Network: **Public access** (no VPC issues!)
   - Master user: `admin` / `PigeonAI2025!`
3. ✅ Status: Creating... (wait 10-15 minutes)

---

## What Happens Next (After Active)

### **Step 1: Get OpenSearch Endpoint (2 minutes)**

1. Go to AWS OpenSearch console
2. Click on domain: `pigeonai-embeddings`
3. Wait for status: Creating → **Active** (green checkmark)
4. Copy the **Domain endpoint** URL
   - Format: `https://search-pigeonai-embeddings-xxxxxx.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com`
5. Save this URL (you'll need it for Lambda)

---

### **Step 2: Install OpenSearch Client (1 minute)**

```bash
cd aws-lambda
npm install @opensearch-project/opensearch
```

This installs the OpenSearch client library for Node.js.

---

### **Step 3: Update Scripts with Your Endpoint (1 minute)**

Open these 2 files and update the endpoint:

**File 1**: `aws-lambda/opensearch/create-index.js`
```javascript
// Line 12: Update this
const OPENSEARCH_ENDPOINT = 'https://search-pigeonai-embeddings-YOUR-ID.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com';
```

**File 2**: `aws-lambda/opensearch/test-vector-search.js`
```javascript
// Line 15: Update this
const OPENSEARCH_ENDPOINT = 'https://search-pigeonai-embeddings-YOUR-ID.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com';
```

---

### **Step 4: Create the Vector Index (1 minute)**

```bash
cd aws-lambda/opensearch
node create-index.js
```

**This creates the `message_embeddings` index with:**
- k-NN vector field (1536 dimensions)
- Cosine similarity distance metric
- HNSW algorithm for fast search

**Expected output**:
```
🔍 Checking if index already exists...
📝 Creating index 'message_embeddings'...
✅ Index created successfully!
🎉 SUCCESS! Index is ready for vector embeddings.
```

---

### **Step 5: Test Vector Search (1 minute)**

```bash
node test-vector-search.js
```

**This tests that k-NN search works by:**
- Inserting 3 sample messages with random embeddings
- Performing k-NN search
- Returning top 3 similar messages

**Expected output**:
```
📝 Inserting sample messages...
✅ Inserted: msg_001 - "We need to decide on the database..."
✅ Inserted: msg_002 - "I recommend using blue-green..."
✅ Inserted: msg_003 - "Production is down..."

🔍 Performing k-NN vector search...

📊 Search Results:
Found 3 results

1. Message ID: msg_002, Score: 0.85
2. Message ID: msg_001, Score: 0.78
3. Message ID: msg_003, Score: 0.42

🎉 SUCCESS! k-NN vector search is working!
✅ Task 15.1 Complete
```

---

## ✅ **Task 15.1 Complete When:**

- [x] OpenSearch cluster status = Active
- [x] Domain endpoint URL obtained
- [x] OpenSearch client installed (`@opensearch-project/opensearch`)
- [x] `message_embeddings` index created
- [x] k-NN search tested and working

---

## **Estimated Time:**

- Wait for cluster: 10-15 minutes (doing nothing, just wait)
- Install + setup + test: 5 minutes (active work)

**Total**: ~20 minutes for Task 15.1

---

## **What Comes After Task 15.1:**

**Task 15.2**: Set up ElastiCache Redis (10 minutes)  
**Task 15.3**: Configure API Gateway endpoints (15 minutes)  
**Task 15.4-15.10**: Lambda setup, dependencies, utilities (30-60 minutes)

**Total PR #15**: 2-3 hours

---

## **While Cluster is Creating (Right Now):**

You can:
1. ☕ Take a break (10-15 min wait)
2. 📖 Review `docs/AWS_INFRASTRUCTURE.md` (understand architecture)
3. 📖 Review `docs/REMOTE_TEAM_PROFESSIONAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (AI feature prompts)
4. ✅ Or just wait - I'll notify you when cluster should be ready

---

**I've created 3 files for you:**
- ✅ `aws-lambda/opensearch/create-index.js` - Run after cluster is active
- ✅ `aws-lambda/opensearch/test-vector-search.js` - Run to verify it works
- ✅ `aws-lambda/opensearch/README.md` - Complete instructions

**When the cluster shows "Active" (in ~10 minutes), come back and tell me!** 

I'll walk you through running the scripts. 🎯
