- Action items assigned
- Blockers identified
- Next steps agreed upon

### Example Input (Sample Conversation)
```
[10:05 AM] Sarah: Hey team, we need to discuss the database migration strategy
[10:07 AM] Mike: I've been looking at two options: blue-green deployment or rolling migration
[10:10 AM] Alex: What's the downtime for each approach?
[10:12 AM] Mike: Blue-green has zero downtime but requires 2x database resources temporarily
[10:15 AM] Sarah: Rolling migration is cheaper but we'd have ~15 min downtime
[10:18 AM] John: We can't afford downtime during business hours
[10:20 AM] Mike: Blue-green it is then. I'll need help from DevOps
[10:22 AM] Sarah: @DevOpsTeam can you assist with the migration?
[10:25 AM] DevOps: Yes, we're available next Tuesday-Wednesday
[10:27 AM] Alex: Perfect. Mike, can you draft the migration plan by Monday?

## AI Feature 2: Action Item Extraction

### Problem Statement
During a sprint planning discussion, multiple tasks are mentioned casually. Alex needs to track:
- "Can you review the PR?" → Who's reviewing what?
- "We need to deploy by Friday" → Who's deploying?
- "@Sarah please update the docs" → Clear assignment

### Solution
"Extract Action Items" button → Structured list of all tasks with:
- Task description
- Assigned person (if mentioned)
- Deadline (if mentioned)
- Priority level
- Link to source message

### Example Input (Sample Conversation)
```
[2:15 PM] Alex: Alright team, let's finalize the sprint tasks
[2:17 PM] Mike: Can someone review my database refactoring PR? It's urgent
[2:18 PM] Sarah: I can review it by end of day
[2:20 PM] Alex: Great. @John, can you deploy the staging environment for QA testing?
[2:22 PM] John: Sure, when do they need it?
[2:23 PM] Alex: By Thursday morning
[2:25 PM] Mike: Don't forget we need to update the API documentation
[2:27 PM] Sarah: I'll take that. Should be done by next Monday
[2:30 PM] Alex: @Mike, after Sarah's review, please merge and deploy to production
[2:32 PM] Mike: Got it. Friday afternoon work for deployment?
[2:33 PM] Alex: Perfect
[2:35 PM] John: Oh, I also need to fix that bug in the auth service
[2:37 PM] Alex: How urgent is that?
[2:38 PM] John: Pretty urgent - users are reporting login issues
[2:40 PM] Alex: Drop the staging deployment, fix the auth bug first
[2:42 PM] John: On it
```

### Expected Output (AI Action Items)
```
📋 Action Items Extracted (8 items)

HIGH PRIORITY:
1. 🔴 Fix auth service bug (login issues)
   Assigned: @John
   Deadline: ASAP
   Source: Message from John at 2:35 PM

```typescript
const ACTION_ITEM_PROMPT = `
You are an AI assistant helping track action items for a software engineering team.

Analyze the following conversation and extract ALL action items (tasks, assignments, to-dos).

For each action item, identify:
1. Task: What needs to be done? (be specific)
2. Assignee: Who is responsible? (look for @mentions, "I'll do it", or context clues)
3. Deadline: When is it due? (convert relative times like "by Friday" to absolute dates if possible)
4. Priority: High (urgent, blocking), Medium (important), or Low (nice-to-have)
5. Message ID: Which message mentioned this task?
6. Dependencies: Does this task depend on another task?

CONVERSATION:
{messages}

## AI Feature 3: Smart Semantic Search (RAG Pipeline)

### Problem Statement
Alex needs to find where the team discussed the database migration approach from 2 weeks ago. Keyword search for "database" returns 500 messages. Needs semantic understanding.

### Solution
Natural language search: "database migration discussion last month" → Top 5 most relevant messages ranked by semantic similarity.

### Example Queries & Expected Results

**Query 1**: "deployment strategy decision"
**Results**:
1. Message from Mike: "Let's go with blue-green deployment for zero downtime"
2. Message from Sarah: "Rolling deployment is cheaper but has downtime"
3. Message from Alex: "We need a deployment strategy that works for 24/7 uptime"

**Query 2**: "API rate limiting implementation"
**Results**:
1. Message from John: "I implemented rate limiting using Redis with token bucket algorithm"
2. Message from Sarah: "We should limit to 100 requests per minute per user"
3. Message from Mike: "The rate limiter is working great in staging"

**Query 3**: "authentication bug"
**Results**:
1. Message from John: "Users are reporting login issues with OAuth"
2. Message from Alex: "The auth service is throwing 500 errors"
3. Message from Mike: "I fixed a similar auth bug last week in the session handler"

### Implementation Details

#### RAG Pipeline Architecture
```
User Query 
  → Generate embedding (OpenAI text-embedding-3-small)
  → Search Firestore /messageEmbeddings/ collection
  → Calculate cosine similarity for all messages in conversation
  → Return top 5 results
  → Display with relevance score
```

#### Backend Implementation

**Step 1: Generate Embeddings on Message Send**
```typescript
// Firestore trigger: When new message is created
export const onMessageCreated = functions.firestore
  .document('conversations/{conversationId}/messages/{messageId}')
  .onCreate(async (snapshot, context) => {
    const message = snapshot.data();
    
    // Generate embedding for message content
    const embedding = await openai.embeddings.create({
      model: 'text-embedding-3-small',
      input: message.content,
    });
    
    // Store embedding in Firestore
    await db.collection('messageEmbeddings').doc(snapshot.id).set({
      messageId: snapshot.id,
      conversationId: context.params.conversationId,
      embedding: embedding.data[0].embedding, // 1536-dimensional vector
      content: message.content, // For debugging
      timestamp: message.timestamp,
      senderId: message.senderId,
    });
  });
```

**Step 2: Semantic Search Function**
```typescript
export const semanticSearch = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
  const { query, conversationId, limit = 5 } = data;
  
  // Authenticate user
  if (!context.auth) {
    throw new functions.https.HttpsError('unauthenticated', 'Must be logged in');
  }
  
  // Generate embedding for query
  const queryEmbedding = await openai.embeddings.create({
    model: 'text-embedding-3-small',
    input: query,
  });
  
  // Fetch all embeddings for this conversation
  const embeddingsSnapshot = await db.collection('messageEmbeddings')
    .where('conversationId', '==', conversationId)
    .get();
  
  // Calculate cosine similarity for each message
  const results = embeddingsSnapshot.docs.map(doc => {
    const data = doc.data();
    const similarity = cosineSimilarity(
      queryEmbedding.data[0].embedding,
      data.embedding
    );
    
    return {
      messageId: data.messageId,
      content: data.content,
      similarity,
      timestamp: data.timestamp,
      senderId: data.senderId,
    };
  });
  
  // Sort by similarity (highest first) and return top N
  results.sort((a, b) => b.similarity - a.similarity);
  return results.slice(0, limit);
});

function cosineSimilarity(vecA: number[], vecB: number[]): number {
  const dotProduct = vecA.reduce((sum, a, i) => sum + a * vecB[i], 0);
  const magnitudeA = Math.sqrt(vecA.reduce((sum, a) => sum + a * a, 0));
  const magnitudeB = Math.sqrt(vecB.reduce((sum, b) => sum + b * b, 0));
  return dotProduct / (magnitudeA * magnitudeB);
}
```

#### Frontend UI
- **Location**: ConversationListScreen (top bar) or ChatScreen header
- **Icon**: Magnifying glass with sparkle
- **Input**: Natural language text field
- **Debounce**: 500ms (don't search on every keystroke)
- **Loading State**: "Searching..."
- **Results Display**:
  - List of messages with snippets
  - Relevance score (visual indicator: 5 stars)
  - Sender name and timestamp
  - Tap to navigate to message in conversation
  - Highlight matching keywords
- **Empty State**: "No results found. Try rephrasing your search."

#### Success Metrics
- **Relevance**: >90% of top-5 results are actually relevant
- **Response Time**: <2 seconds
- **User Satisfaction**: Faster than scrolling/keyword search

## AI Feature 4: Priority Message Detection

### Problem Statement
Production is down, but the urgent message is buried among 50 casual messages. Alex needs automatic flagging of urgent/high-priority messages.

### Solution
Auto-analyze every message for urgency. Flag high-priority messages with:
- Red badge on message bubble
- Push notification with "URGENT" prefix
- Filter: "Show high priority messages only"

### Example Messages & Classifications

**HIGH PRIORITY**:
- "URGENT: Production database is down, users can't login" → 🔴
- "Critical bug in payment processing, need immediate fix" → 🔴
- "Deployment failed, rollback needed ASAP" → 🔴
- "Security vulnerability found, we need to patch now" → 🔴

**MEDIUM PRIORITY**:
- "Can you review this PR when you have time?" → 🟡
- "We should discuss the API design before implementing" → 🟡
- "Staging environment is acting slow, not blocking" → 🟡

**LOW PRIORITY**:
- "Good morning team!" → 🟢
- "Just pushed a small UI fix" → 🟢
- "FYI, I'll be out tomorrow" → 🟢
- "Check out this cool article" → 🟢

### Implementation Details

#### Backend Prompt (GPT-4)
```typescript
const PRIORITY_DETECTION_PROMPT = `
You are an AI assistant helping a software engineering team prioritize messages.

Analyze this message and classify its urgency/priority:

MESSAGE:
{messageContent}

CONTEXT:
- This is a work chat for a software engineering team
- Production issues are high priority
- Security issues are high priority
- Blocking issues are high priority
- Casual discussion is low priority
- Questions/requests without urgency are medium priority

Return ONLY one word: "high", "medium", or "low"

PRIORITY LEVELS:
- high: Urgent, needs immediate attention (production down, security issue, blocking bug, deadline today)
- medium: Important but not urgent (code review requests, technical questions, planning discussions)
- low: General updates, casual chat, FYI messages, social messages

Classification:
`;
```

#### Implementation Strategy
**Option 1: Real-time (on message send)**
- Firestore trigger on message creation
- Call OpenAI to classify priority
- Update message document with priority field
- Push notification if high priority

**Option 2: Batch (periodic)**
- Analyze last N messages every 5 minutes
- More cost-effective
- Slight delay in flagging

**Recommendation**: Option 1 for high-value users, Option 2 for MVP

#### Frontend UI
- **Badge**: Small colored indicator on message bubble
  - 🔴 Red "!" for high priority
  - 🟡 Yellow dot for medium (subtle, optional)
  - No indicator for low priority
- **Filter**: Dropdown in chat header
  - "Show All Messages"
  - "High Priority Only"
  - "Medium & High Only"
- **Count**: "3 high priority messages" badge
- **Notifications**: High priority messages trigger push notification with "⚠️ URGENT" prefix

#### Success Metrics
- **Accuracy**: >90% correct classification
- **False Positives**: <5% (don't flag casual messages as urgent)
- **False Negatives**: <3% (don't miss truly urgent messages)
- **Response Time**: <1 second per message

## AI Feature 5: Decision Tracking

### Problem Statement
In a 200-message architecture discussion, the team made several key decisions:
- Use PostgreSQL (not MongoDB)
- Deploy on AWS (not GCP)
- Microservices architecture (not monolith)

Two weeks later, someone asks "Did we decide on PostgreSQL or MongoDB?" Alex can't remember where that was discussed.

### Solution
"Track Decisions" button → Timeline of all agreed-upon decisions with:
- What was decided
- When it was decided
- Who agreed
- Context/reasoning
- Link to source messages

### Example Input (Sample Conversation)
```
[10:00 AM] Alex: We need to finalize our database choice today
[10:05 AM] Mike: I've been researching PostgreSQL and MongoDB
[10:10 AM] Sarah: What are the trade-offs?
[10:15 AM] Mike: PostgreSQL has better ACID guarantees, MongoDB is more flexible
[10:20 AM] John: Do we need flexible schema?
[10:25 AM] Sarah: Not really, our data model is pretty stable
[10:30 AM] Alex: I'm leaning towards PostgreSQL for reliability
[10:35 AM] Mike: Agreed. PostgreSQL is the better choice for our use case
[10:40 AM] Sarah: Sounds good to me
[10:45 AM] John: +1 for PostgreSQL
[10:50 AM] Alex: Alright, PostgreSQL it is. Mike, can you set up the instance?
[Later...]
[2:00 PM] Alex: Next topic - cloud provider. AWS or GCP?
[2:05 PM] Sarah: We have AWS credits from the accelerator program
[2:10 PM] Mike: AWS it is then
[2:15 PM] Alex: Everyone agree? (John, Sarah?)
[2:20 PM] John: Yep, AWS works
[2:22 PM] Sarah: Agreed

    }
    return false;
  },
};
```

**Step 2: Extract Meeting Details Tool**
```typescript
const extractMeetingDetails = {
  name: 'extract_meeting_details',
  description: 'Extracts meeting details from conversation',
  parameters: {
    messages: 'array',
  },
  execute: async (messages: string[]) => {
    const prompt = `
      Extract meeting details from this conversation:
      ${messages.join('\n')}
      
      Return JSON:
      {
        "topic": "what is the meeting about?",
        "participants": ["list of people mentioned"],
        "duration": "duration in minutes (default 30)",
        "timeframe": "when should it be? (e.g., 'next week', 'tomorrow')",
        "location": "physical or virtual? (default: virtual)"
      }
    `;
    
    const result = await llm.predict(prompt);
    return JSON.parse(result);
  },
};
```

**Step 3: Suggest Times Tool**
```typescript
const suggestOptimalTimes = {
  name: 'suggest_optimal_times',
  description: 'Suggests 3 meeting times across timezones',
  parameters: {
    participants: 'array',
    duration: 'number',
    timeframe: 'string',
  },
  execute: async ({ participants, duration, timeframe }) => {
    // For MVP: Simple algorithm
    // Future: Integrate with Google Calendar API
    
    const timezones = {
      'Alex': 'America/Los_Angeles',
      'Sarah': 'Europe/London',
      'Mike': 'America/Los_Angeles',
      'John': 'Asia/Kolkata',
    };
    
    // Find 3 times that are:
    // - Within working hours for all timezones (9 AM - 6 PM local)
    // - In the specified timeframe
    // - Avoid weekends
    
    const suggestions = [];
    
    // Algorithm: Try to find overlap between 9 AM - 6 PM for all timezones
    // PST 9 AM = GMT 5 PM = IST 10:30 PM (late for IST)
    // PST 8 AM = GMT 4 PM = IST 9:30 PM (acceptable)
    
    suggestions.push({
      time: '2025-10-29T09:00:00-07:00', // PST
      timezoneDisplay: {
        PST: '9:00 AM',
        GMT: '5:00 PM',
        IST: '10:30 PM',
      },
      score: 0.9, // Best overlap
      warning: null,
    });
    
    // Add 2 more suggestions...
    
    return suggestions;
  },
};
```

**Step 4: Generate Calendar Invite Tool**
```typescript
const generateCalendarInvite = {
  name: 'generate_calendar_invite',
  description: 'Generates calendar invite links',
  parameters: {
    title: 'string',
    datetime: 'string',
    duration: 'number',
    participants: 'array',
  },
  execute: async ({ title, datetime, duration, participants }) => {
    // Generate Google Calendar URL
    const startTime = new Date(datetime);
    const endTime = new Date(startTime.getTime() + duration * 60000);
    
    const googleCalendarUrl = `https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=${encodeURIComponent(title)}&dates=${formatGoogleDate(startTime)}/${formatGoogleDate(endTime)}&details=${encodeURIComponent(`Participants: ${participants.join(', ')}`)}&sf=true&output=xml`;
    
    return {
      googleCalendarUrl,
      outlookUrl: '...', // Similar for Outlook
      icsFile: '...', // Generate .ics file
    };
  },
};
```

**Agent Orchestration** (LangChain)
```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from '@langchain/openai';
import { AgentExecutor, createOpenAIFunctionsAgent } from 'langchain/agents';

const agent = await createOpenAIFunctionsAgent({
  llm: new ChatOpenAI({ model: 'gpt-4', temperature: 0 }),
  tools: [
    detectSchedulingIntent,
    extractMeetingDetails,
    suggestOptimalTimes,
    generateCalendarInvite,
  ],
  prompt: `
    You are a scheduling assistant for a distributed software engineering team.
    Your goal is to help users schedule meetings across multiple timezones efficiently.
    
    Follow these steps:
    1. Detect if the user wants to schedule a meeting
    2. Extract meeting details (topic, participants, duration, timeframe)
    3. Suggest 3 optimal times that work for all timezones
    4. Generate calendar invite once user selects a time
    
    Always be proactive, helpful, and considerate of timezone differences.
  `,
});

const executor = new AgentExecutor({
  agent,
  tools,
  verbose: true,
});

// Run the agent
const result = await executor.invoke({
  input: "Hey team, we need to sync about the database migration strategy. Can we schedule something for next week?",
});
```

#### Frontend UI
- **Proactive Banner**: Appears at bottom of chat when scheduling intent detected
- **Modal Workflow**:
  - Step 1: Confirm extracted details (editable)
  - Step 2: Loading state ("Checking availability...")
  - Step 3: Select from 3 suggested times
  - Step 4: Confirm and generate calendar invite
- **Progress Indicator**: Show which step user is on (1/4, 2/4, etc.)
- **Cancel Anytime**: User can dismiss the assistant

#### Success Metrics
- **Accuracy**: >85% for detecting scheduling intent
- **Time Saved**: Reduce scheduling time from 15+ minutes to <2 minutes
- **User Satisfaction**: "Would you use this again?" >90% yes
- **Completion Rate**: >80% of users complete the workflow
- **Response Time**: <15 seconds for complete workflow

## OpenAI API Key Setup

When implementing, you'll need:
```bash
# In Cloud Functions environment
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Models to use:
# - gpt-4 (for accuracy in summarization, decisions, scheduling)
# - gpt-3.5-turbo (for priority detection - faster, cheaper)
# - text-embedding-3-small (for semantic search RAG)
```

**Cost Estimates** (for testing):
- GPT-4: $0.03/1K input tokens, $0.06/1K output tokens
- GPT-3.5-turbo: $0.001/1K input tokens, $0.002/1K output tokens
- Embeddings: $0.0001/1K tokens

**Budget for MVP**: ~$50-100 for development + testing
